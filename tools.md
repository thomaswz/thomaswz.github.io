# tools

###### Created 22 April 2020, Updated 22 April 2020

I have not completely solved the tools... its expensive to do so.

## hardware and desktop

I like to look at one screen. It is a 24" so can be split `windows key + arrows` if necessary.  
If I need to refer to other code then I open a separate desktop `windows key + tab` as if I keep the same session I sometimes have copied or edited the wrong version. It has an i7 and SSD, so is fast... Its important to not wait for every code refresh!

I have a slower laptop, so have found it easier to Remote Desktop into the desktop if I feel like working portably.

I also have an iPad... really nice to watch the Youtube coders and use to refer to stackoverflow. They are expensive but I would recommend the investment.

## code editor

I use Visual Studio Code... with "Bracket Pair Colorizer 2", and the "Material Icon" theme. The standard ESLint and Prettier... wit some Markdown editors etc. [Visual studio setup](/vssetup).

Its good to know the shortcuts like `Ctrl + B` closes the Explorer and `Ctrl + K V` splits the screen... [Visual Studio Code Shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf).

## frontend and serverless

I have learnt [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and then [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/) and for theming I like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) well actually [Bootstrap Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) and have setup my browser to automatically open on:

- [Bootstrap Components](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components)
- localhost:3000
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and databases

Things I need to check out are:

- [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) Free themes for Bootstrap
- [Rethinkdb](https://bootswatch.com/) It just looks so easy to work
