# Bezier Paths

###### Created 17 Jan 2021, Updated 17 Jan 2021

## Introduction

Bezier paths are mathematical calculation of co-ordinates. They have

- lines paths between the lines; curved sections.
- nodes / anchor points. These are **circular**.
- handles / Control Arms: are within the nodes and control the curveture of the handle.These are **square**

The standard is Active with the Handles retracted i.e. the squares on top of the circles.

### Mouse

The mouse has a lot of details.

### Path types

- polygonal
  - open
    closed
- polygonal curved
  - open
  - closed
- curved
  - open
  - closed

### Handles

- Free i.e. each moves indpendently
- Symetrical i.e. both move together (mouse - left click + shift)

## Move

- click + alt is a specific path
- click + alt + shift selects all the paths and can move them together.

## Curves

- to create a short curve, on the corner of a square, put two nodes on either side of the corner, then click the corner node and **backspace** it
- to make a node curved, hold the node (ctrl) then drag it out and then press **shift** to change the line
- Ctrl + Shift on the node handles retracts it
- Use **polygonal** to retain the straight vs curved lines
