# Arrow Functions

###### Created 10 May 2020, Updated 10 May 2020

## Introduction

This is the last part of the data flow... it might be easy to start here as these summarise a lot of what is required... but ay, foundations are foundations... and I was tripped up when I tried to debug and did not know when to use `try...catch`

## Approach

> Its best to start with [Functions](./functions.md).  
> Then to move onto [Arrow Functions](./arrowfunctions.md);  
> Then to move onto [Promises and Callbacks ](./promisescallbacks.md); and  
> Only then to review [Async Await](./asyncetc.md).  
> After all of this... comes [Try... Catch](./trycatch.md)

> It is also important to know about [this](./this.md), as it will trip you up... and then you will learn about `this`.
