# Arrow Functins

###### Created 10 May 2020, Updated 10 May 2020

## Introduction

This is the last part of the data flow... it might be easy to start here as these summarise a lot of what is required... but ay, foundations are foundations... and I was tripped up when I tried to debug and did not know when to use `try...catch`

## Approach

> Its best to start with [Functions](/code/functions).  
> Then to move onto [Arrow Functions](/code/arrowfunctions);  
> Then to move onto [Promises and Callbacks ](/code/promisescallbacks); and  
> Only then to review [Async Await](/code/asyncetc).  
> After all of this... comes [Try... Catch](/code/trycatch)

> It is also important to know about [this](/code/this), as it will trip you up... and then you will learn about `this` :-).
