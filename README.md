# welcome to my programming notes

## overview

So I don't have a history or training in programming... it is very new to me in all aspects. I plan to use these pages to document my thoughts, methodology and progress. I also intent to use these for my notes - and they are public so may be useful to anyone who happens to stumble on them

## contents

[code](/code/contents)  
[vue / nuxt](/nuxt/contents)  
[useful links](/links)  
[effective coding](/environment)  
[tools](/tools)

I would also like to document some of the coding areas: [coding](/code/contents)

I need to build a CSS folder, but for the moment, use this awesome [colour resource](http://veli.ee/colorpedia/?c=00c254) thanks to [Nada Rifki](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/author/nada-rifki)
