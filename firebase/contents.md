# Local

This refers to the local machine.

## Setup

This can be confusing when understanding it from the official docs.

Firebase can be accessed as follows:

- It can be controlled through _nodejs_ running on the local machine. This is useful for setting up _functions_ and _functionality_.
- Through running a server as part of the dev environment.
- Through the browser and into the firebase projects folder.
- It will also then run in the production environment.
