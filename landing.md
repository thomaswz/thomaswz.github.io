# welcome to my programming notes

## overview

So I don't have a history or training in programming... it is very new to me in all aspects. I plan to use these pages to document my thoughts, methodology and progress. I also intent to use these for my notes - and they are public so may be useful to anyone who happens to stumble on them

## contents

[code](./code/contents.md)  
[vue / nuxt](./nuxt/contents.md)  
[useful links](./links.md)  
[effective coding](./environment.md)  
[tools](./tools.md)

I would also like to document some of the coding areas: [coding](/code/contents)
