# coding is complex

###### Created 22 April 2020, Updated 22 April 2020

## confusion

I find that I have spent hours and hours reading and researching about how to do things. I would then sit down and not be clear on what do do.

## knowing yourself

For part of the work I do, I need to absorb a lot of information to observe trends and themes. I can't do this with coding. With coding there are so many options, so many rabbit trails and recommendations that it requires a focussed approach.

## being effective

The way that I am most effective when determining a coding topic is to:

- get all the sources that address the topic i.e. youtube, udemy, tutorials, stackoverflow, web docks, etc...
- sit down at a table
- with white paper and coloured pens
- draw up what each proposes
- then determine then I will
  - determine the approach that I want to take
  - identify the parts that i want to incorporate

Its easier not to be disciplined like this - to lie on my bed and read up on stuff... but it is not effective and I have ended up wasting a lot of time doing this.

> discipline is the path to freedom  
> failure to plan is planning to fail

## other approaches

Some people like to hack away, work things out as the arise... like I said above... _know yourself_. The end result is to completed the assigned task.
